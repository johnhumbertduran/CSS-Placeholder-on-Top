# CSS Placeholder on Top
 Placeholder is placed at the upper part inside the textbox.

 The placeholder will disappear when you type something but if you want to remain the placeholder at the top, I have done a different set of codes here: https://github.com/johnhumbertduran/CSS-Placeholder-and-Label-on-Top
