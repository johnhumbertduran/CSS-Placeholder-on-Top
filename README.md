# CSS Placeholder on Top
 Placeholder is placed at the upper part inside the textbox.
 
Important Note: Bootstrap 4.3.1 is included as CDN. So incase you wonder
the code does not work properly, it is because you have no internet connection
to connect to bootstrap CDN.

 The placeholder will disappear when you type something
but if you want to remain the placeholder at the top,
I have done a different set of codes here:
